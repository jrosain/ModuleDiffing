## String Diffing

We implement the 4 following algorithms for string diffing in OCaml:
1. Jaccard's similarity
2. Jaro-Winkler Algorithm
3. (Extended-)Damereau-Levenshtein Algorithm
4. Myer's Algorithm

This subdirectory is composed of a main file that's used to execute the implementation of the different algorithms. Once you've finished to implement it, do not forget to add the option to call your algorithm in the main file.  
If possible, contribute some examples in the `examples` folder.
