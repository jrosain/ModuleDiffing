[matching_characters_count s1 s2] returns the number of matching characters between [s1] and [s2].

where |s1| and |s2| are the lengths of the strings s1 and s2 respectively.

[get_transposition_count s1 s2] calculates the number of transpositions between two strings s1 and s2.
A transposition occurs when two adjacent characters in s1 are in a different order in s2.
For example, in the strings "MARTHA" and "MARHTA", the transposition occurs between 'T' and 'H'.
